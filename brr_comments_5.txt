Money printer go brrrrr is my current favorite
J Powell’s money printer goes brrrrr, baby!
Money Printer go BRRRRR  


They just simply type some digits into a computer and go "presto! more money!"

They've been doing it to the tune of BILLIONS a month to shore up the 1% and big business, but now we're considering giving the man on the street some help, suddenly running the money printer is the literal end of the world.
And just where in the great flying fuck is this money supposed to come from? The dollar is already falling substantially, and just because the money printer go brrrrr doesn’t mean it should. If the US had never left the gold standard we wouldn’t be 22 fucking trillion (with a god damn T) in debt, the dollar would be one of the strongest first world currencies in the world, and stupid socialists like sanders wouldn’t have a chance in hell in any politics.

For fucks sake, can you entitled pricks not wake the hell up and see past your fucking nose as to what you’re creating. The American dollar is soon going to be valued more as wallpaper than used to buy wallpaper.
And making engine noises when he’s pretending to drive trucks. [VROOM VROOM BRRRRRR BRRRRR](https://i.imgur.com/4fF6psy.jpg)
