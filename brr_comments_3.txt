Give an enormous amount of free money to large corps and the ultra-wealthy. Give a smaller amount of free money to the little guy. Make money printer go brrr so stonks only go up. Win votes from people who value their investment portfolios over their physical safety. Win votes from people who buy into his saber-rattling and blame China and Mexico for everything. For everyone else - hope the virus kills them. If it doesn't, then sabotage the voting process and disenfranchise them by any means possible. If they vote anyway, deny the legitimacy of the election and whip up his fanatical followers to storm the capitol.
I believe up until recently americas demand for vaccines was outpacing its supply. So it was reasonable for america to keep its vaccines. However now that might be starting to reverse so seems just reasonable that we start dishing them out.

I agree that how well americas doing in vaccines isnt really global leadership. Im not sure many other countries could replicate what america achieved with vaccines since the J&amp;J/Pf/M are made here and the federal government has the ability to just buy however many it needs and make the printer go brrr

Exactly start with the corps and then the ceos and then the wealthy. Every country should copy this format. 

If the commander in chief of that country did care, he’d also secretly just print money to fix not just the country’s physical infrastructure, but also every type of said country’s infrastructure. 

Just make that money printer go “brrr”.
Stimulus checks, bailouts, etc aren't printing money all it can do is increase the national debt which has only ever increased for like 30+ years now. 

For prices to rise due to inflation that you need to talk to Jerome  "J Dog" Powell and low if not 0% interest rates.

I YIELD THE BALANCE OF MY TIME (mostly because I agree with most of what you are saying, and also because I have to put my kids to bed).  We just differ in some of the details, which is totally fine.

I am a licensed professional (Architect), and can pay my loans, like most doctors/lawyers etc..  Reducing or eliminating the interest rate, even on grad school debt, even for people like me, is not going to ruin the economy or blow up the national debt.  Even forgiving the loans outright will not have an appreciable negative effect.  Arguably, it would be a net positive.  We as a country spend far more money on far less important things (Trump tax cut, Iraq war, military budget, etc.)  We could also tax billionaires more, etc.  Cancelling all debt, and making tuition affordable/free, would cost less than many of these other items.  Point is, we as a country can afford it, it's just a matter of political will, not a congressional budget problem.  The national debt issue IS the shiny object politicians use to dissuade us as citizens from real change.  The national debt is a non starter, and not a real issue that we need to worry about in this context.  With JPOW at the helm, and a growing economy, in many ways money is not finite.  Printer goes BRRR as they say.

Regarding mortgages, not sure I would equate those with student loans.  For one, mortgage debt is many orders of magnitude higher in aggregate than student loan debt.  Also, one could argue that a college education is a wealth generator, while a mortgage is a wealth stabilizer (yes, sometimes equity helps increase net worth, but not as much as 30+ years of a higher salary due to a college degree).  As I think you would agree, the real structural issue is making housing more affordable (like tuition should be).  

I'm sticking to my triage analogy.  Treat the heart attack (student loan debt) first, then deal with the long term institutional challenges in the system that created the problem (better diet, exercise, reduced tuition, predatory lending, etc.).

As an Architect ;), I would agree the hole in the roof IS the most important problem, but in a rainstorm, you are going to manage the wet floor first, THEN fix the roof later.  You can treat the symptom, while also knowing the cause.  Its not a binary choice.  It's a matter of prioritizing.

Who would pay for that?  The USA is $28 TRILLION in debt and it's increasing exponentially.  Just 10 years ago it was half that.  Money printer goes brrr indeed. We need to return to fiscal responsibility and balance the budget by cutting spending across the board and increasing taxes.
This is such a cop out imho. Like, you realize this whole thing is just made up at this point? Somebody somewhere is literally saying money machine go brrrr and a bunch of people are here saying well wait it’s making the brrr noise you can’t just do that. Either the dude is worth billions of dollars or he ain’t.

A lot of stupid comments in here. The people calling for forgiving utility bills are the same people who would support student loan forgiveness

So not republicans.

Money machine go brrr
I agree that the banks will see it that way.  

My rebuttal to that perspective is that not everyone is in the position of my family.  My family stayed dual income with no layoffs.  We both in fact got raises in 2020. 

For us, the stimulus money goes straight to paying off what we were gonna do anyway, and then spend a little bit on stupid stuff like a nintendo switch (that's where my 600$ check went).  

But many many more people are not in my position.  Without the stimulus, they don't have the money they need to pay the bills that they already had before the pandemic.  

Without the stimulus, they default on their car note and/or mortgage.  Thus, the trickle up of the stimulus still bails out the banks.  

But the banks retort will be "Gooberment need to make money machine go brrr and only point money machine at us because banks are special"

No, my cousin's attitude is more along the lines of "Haha Trump make nation go brrr."  Every time I resolve to just not talk to him and hope his apathy leads to not voting, but then he'll make some lofty sarcastic remarks hiding belief of blatant untruths and I often fail in biting my tongue.
&gt; Maybe I'm not familiar with the exact wording, but a keyword search for NFA on that bill turns up nothing. It looks like they are raising the tax on sale and transfer of firearms,

Go into the text and look at the last instance of "$500"

"(A) by striking “$200” and inserting “$500”; and"

&gt; We're so hopelessly outgunned in that situation, and we've been happily funding the military industrial complex to give them the means to outgun everyone on the planet.

Go tell that to people in the Middle East who have nothing but flip-flops and rusted AKs from the 60s. Tanks, drones, aircraft is not how you maintain a population.

I do not believe that there is any chance in hell that the government could win against a legitimate insurgency in their own nation that has even 5% of the population supporting it. Good luck fighting against a guerilla war with people embedded in your own population.

&gt; I'm in favor of gun rights within reason, but I'm also in favor of legislation to put a damper on gun violence.

97% of firearm homicides are committed with _handguns_, not "assault weapons" and the weapons being targetted here. AR-15s kill... I believe less than 100 people a year in the US.

These bans won't do jack-shit.

&gt; but 100 assault weapons doesn't seem excessive to you?

I do not believe in limits to the amount of weapons I can own, but also - it is 100 ___items___, not weapons. Under Biden's plans, magazines are also considered regulated items.

To put it in perspective - essentially every firearm designed after the 1890s will be banned. If it is automatic and has a detachable magazine, it is banned.

And finally - good luck banning something anyone can build with $300 of tools in their garage with minimal to no skills.

And so on. I can teach someone how to build a gun with a 3D printer and homemade ECM rifling setup in 2-3 days. The upfront cost of such a thing is $300 US. The unit cost per gun is $50.

There are also 3D printed bullet molds. Homemade primers, homemade smokeless powder... it's all becoming easier and easier by the day. 50 years ago, you may have needed an expensive, hard to maintain machine shop. Today? You can do it in under $1000 with information freely available on the internet.

The other 7 trillion mysteriously lines up with the market gain, which was inexplicable considering the state of the actual world
False choice. Turns out energy generation is going green because it's cheaper and other considerations (nobody has a monopoly on sunlight, you can't embargo the wind).  The research is now being done because there is gold in them thar hills. "My tax money" doesn't have to sponsor either one.

Not that any of us actually pays our share of taxes anyway. This "my tax money" meme is shown the lie by the fact that deficits are greater than collections. We could now have the classic battle about where that money comes from, and someone will write "moneyprinter says brrr" so let's not.

You're advocating that we put money on this. We will or we won't, but either way: the fossil fuel industry is going the way of the dinosaur, and with it the overproduction of CO2. With that loss the biosphere definitely will take care of the rest.

And... Nuclear. It costs too much and takes too long to build. Your investment in green energy is pumping juice and starts repaying on the capital in as little as 90 days instead of accumulating compound interest, delays and 3x cost overruns for 15-20 years before delivering juice at 4x today's wholesale cost per watt hour. America will never build another nuclear power plant.

&gt; See, they make dollars. Imagine if you needed an extra $600 dollars to make rent, you could just write $600 on a piece of paper and your landlord would take it. That's how federal spending works. If the US needed to pay off its "debts" today, they'd just print $26+ trillion dollars and be done with it (and obviously, that amount of inflation would destroy its value, but the debts would be paid).


money printer goes brrr
Because the fed money printer go brrr and the stonks go up.
Yeah, the problem is, as Boomers are retiring (now and into 2020's), Millenials aren't paying into social security and 401k's at the same rate as their generation did.

Gen X, Millenials, and Zoomers make less than Boomers with every generation. Good luck with that.

Ultimately with an aging population living longer, we will have a Japanification of our economy and stock market (it's not great).

As they pull out their money from the stock market, it will collapse in value. First come first serve. Millennials will not be able to prop it up. Money printer go brrr will not fix it.

They will never be able to retire when they wanted, or something will have to change to allow it to happen (Medicare for all? Univeral income?).
When the Fed money machine stops going brrr, Odin help us all. They're burning the country. Holy shit Nixon's crimes lo ok like a joke now.
If we were just consistent it'd make more sense.  Person who loses their income and can't survive 3 months without it.  Reaction is "You should have saved!  Irresponsible to your family.  Pick yourself up by your bootstrap" and the need for fiscal conservatism.

Business finds it can't make it 3 months without income.  Reaction: trillions in direct aid, buying corporate bonds, stocks, and J Pow make the printer go brrr.

I can understand arguments for fiscal conservatism, I can understand arguments for more kensyian proactive steps.  I can't understand giving companies money but leaving people to twist in the wind.  Personally I'd rather see people get the benefit of the doubt than companies.  Letting companies fall and restart new has less ethical concerns than the same with humans.  

But if we have to bail everything out, our people, the citizens of the US should receive benefits at least equal to the companies. Companies who are easier to replace.

I mean, the US is far behind many other actually developed nations, in metrics that are a lot more relevant to most people. But the stock market goes brrr, so people don't seem to care.
Go over to r/WallStreetBets and click the first post you see that mentions Powell or Brrr... this is a glimpse into the atmosphere at the Fed right now
Depends on how hard the money press goes brrr.

A contraction of outstanding credit _can_ lead to deflation as the nominal total of money in the economy goes down, but if you just go brrr that much harder to keep the happy numbers from going down, hyperinflation happens.

I'm fairly sure the current US government does not understand that the economy involves more than the headline numbers.
It's a lot worse than that. We're subsidizing failing corporations, banks and 1% stock portfolios to the tune of "how fast can the Fed brrr the printer" right now, trillions of dollars. We were living in the most winner-take-all economy in history before COVID hit. Now, the dynamics of this economy are going to shift even further as these banks, 1% individuals, and corporations are going to use all this new capital to acquire even more wealth- as they pick up assets through foreclosures, shuttering small businesses, etc. They are going to buy up and consolidate wealth to a truly staggering degree, while riding in the wake of the destruction of our lives and communities, that they are helping to create. 


This is what politicians across the spectrum don't seem to understand, or have been too corrupted over time they simply can't see it for what it is. Giving money to banks and corporations to appease the stock market is no longer connected to our well being. We are printing money, and we need to start giving it to ourselves. We need to restart this economy to trickle-up.
Haha, goalposts go brrr.

There's no change that's good enough sans stepping down and letting Sanders take his spot for some of these people.

Progressives are always (absurdly) insisting that Trump is going to outflank Biden to the left on various issues. So it's funny that the first actual instance of this phenomena comes from Biden, who just outflanked Trump to the right with a massive populist/nationalist economic plan.

This is a titanic amount of public spending with no funding mechanisms in sight, which makes me think (A) Team Biden thinks there is a realistic shot they can win the White House AND the Senate, and (B) they are planning to actually just make the money printers go "brrr" for real.

I admit, I'm pleasantly surprised by this. This plan could have come word-for-word straight off of Bernie's website.
Why do people like you always associate self-reflection with self-hate? Have you ever considered that maybe, *just maybe*, American’s might be waking up the fact that the American exceptionalism that the country was raised on may not be so true anymore? 

Why is adapting and recognising change for the sake of improvement suddenly just “sElf HaTing AmeRicAns brrr”. That’s literally just closing your eyes and saying “lalalalalala if problems exist it’s because you hate yourself”. Maybe problems exist because.. there’s problems?
haha pedophile detector go brrr
They're still interested in balancing new costs with cost cuts elsewhere, but only when it's something proposed by a Democrat.  If it's a Trump scheme, machine go brrr.

Every store in the country has a little pen that can tell you if a bill is fake or not, and they're trying to tell us that they have no recourse for counterfeit ballots? Maybe JPow can get those Fed printers going brrr with ballots, too.

.. but *that* is also drowned out by the even louder Southern-Strategy-originated brrr of the r/HofellerDocuments showing just how racist and grossly undemocratic the RNC's gerrymandering efforts are.. and how successful..
Republicans are opposed to that.  They might recognize the need to buy votes as we close on the election.

But at some point the dollar collapses if moneyprinter continues to go brrr.

Many people are aware of the popular numbers, i.e. unemployment rates, but I've seen very little discussion around the [enormous inflation](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MZM) of the United States' [money of zero maturity \(aka MZM\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply#Empirical_measures_in_the_United_States_Federal_Reserve_System). MZM is a count of spendable US dollars, and its velocity is one of the best measures of future inflation that we have. Since the virus began the US has been printing money at an astounding rate. There are 22% more spendable US dollars in existence today than there were in February. In early Feb there were 17 trillion US dollars. Today there are 20.7 trillion US dollars. You may have seen memes on /r/wallstreetbets talking about money printers going brrr - this is what they're referring to. 

If you view your savings / overall net worth as a percentage of US spendable dollars, your net worth has dropped 18% since February. Inflation will follow this downturn and things will start to cost more, and minimum wage will have far less purchasing power.
It's all good, I get it. 

If you say anything other than 'bIden makE eConOMy gO bRRr" you get attacked on all sides, so I get being on edge.

Seriously though, there is no way out of this one - none that makes sense anyway. Setting negative interest rates in the biggest global financial power would wreak havoc on both domestic and international markets. Increasing the money supply has so far not led to much inflation. I'm not an economist, but I wouldn't be surprised if that money is offshored so quickly that it doesn't have a chance to affect the domestic economy. The US Government cannot continue to buy toxic assets forever, lest the country go bankrupt. 

The only way to get out of a crisis like this is not through stimulus, but through redistribution. And no, that does not mean taking money out of the bank accounts of the super wealthy and putting it into the pockets of poor people. It means things like increasing the minimum wage, tackling the affordable housing crisis, instituting wage caps/ratios, healthcare reform, increasing the capital gains tax, getting unpaid labor out of the prison system and turning it into paying jobs for the non-incarcerated, and more. In other words, systemic change is needed. And before anyone says UBI, just stop. At this point, UBI is not necessary. Worse, it is counter-productive to increasing the prosperity of the working/middle class.
The “brrr” slider actually adjusting the speed is a nice touch

&gt; but added money to help citizen

How is said money being "added"? The whole point is that this money is either putting us in more debt or raising inflation because printer go brrr. We don't have the money now and magically declaring that everyone deserves $2k a month isn't going to make it appear without negative economic effects. Do I agree we should be spending as much as we do on military and other countries' defense? No, but that doesn't make the situation right now any different. And yes, 11% of $2T is $220B, good job. I'm not sure how that is relevant at all to be quite honest.

If money printer go brrr to prop up the stock market, then money printer can go brr again to prop up regular people. It's not a good policy in the long run because of inflation, but do we have any better ideas for preventing or mitigating Great Depression II?

It's not money, it's numbers. You already have the Fed doing unlimited QE and buying junk bonds from literally anyone and everyone. Just have the fed buy ALL debt.

So where does the money come from? As much as I hate using the "money printer go brrr" meme, it's basically true. The Fed can just create as much money as it wants, especially because right now deflation is a very serious concern.
Money printer go brrr isn’t the solution. We arent the richest country and we can’t just pay people to stay home. Where are you planning to take that money from?
lol, a large segment would remain digital currency. Post pandemic removing cash from circulation over a period.

Another option is to look at actual brrr printing but instead of federal notes do a temporary course of greenbacks.
