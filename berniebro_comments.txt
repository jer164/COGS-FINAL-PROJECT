I'm imagining Bernie Sanders banging on their bedroom door in the middle of the night like "I am once again asking you to pay your freaking taxes!"
&gt;	Yes, it‚Äôs entirely impossible that people on Reddit could also be West Virginian lol

This is true. But they might not be as informed on broader economic conditions and the needs of the state like someone who has economic advisors with actual data and what not. Maybe just maybe manchin is familiar with (or his advisors) this [study](https://www.hamiltonproject.org/assets/legacy/files/downloads_and_links/state_local_minimum_wage_policy_dube.pdf) which found that dollar amount increases don‚Äôt matter as much the increase relative to the area. A minimum wage hike could hit the small towns of West Virginia the hardest. 

Or maybe this [study](https://www.nber.org/papers/w23532?utm_source=npr_newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=20190422&amp;utm_campaign=money&amp;utm_term=nprnews) that found a minimum wage increase in Seattle led to low wage workers working less hours and becoming slightly poorer because of it. 

&gt;	It‚Äôs also been very apparent in recent history that politicians are deeply in tune with what the people of their states really need, you got me.

Thanks for agreeing with me. Looking at bidens stimulus plan there‚Äôs a lot of great stuff in there. The EITC is expected to cut the annual poverty rate by 40% according to [this](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/house-covid-relief-bill-includes-critical-expansions-of-child-tax-credit-and) left leaning think tank. And another [study](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/2021-poverty-projections-assessing-four-american-rescue-plan-policies) found the stimulus bill would lift 16 million people out of poverty. Sounds like good policy to me. Sounds like the expansion of the EITC is really good for the people of west virginia. Wouldn‚Äôt you agree? 

I am once again asking: what is wrong with raising the minimum wage to $11 and then indexing it so we don‚Äôt have to wait over a decade for the next wage increase?
