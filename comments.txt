Money printer go brrrrr is my current favorite
Haha money printer go brrrrrr.
Probably just fancy camera work. Appreciate the downvotes for asking a question to the leftist Reddit mob. In 6mos to a year you‚Äôll wish you had gold, guns, food, and a bunker with how Jerome Powpow is making the money printer go brrrrrrr. Peace out ‚úåüèª
Money printer goes brrrrrrrr!
Joe signs it and stimulus goes brrrrrrrrr

But when banks and corporations need bailouts money go brrrrrrrrrr

Money printer goes brrrrrrrrrrr.

It‚Äôs a poll to see what the general view is of that short term idiotic move will have on the long term economic outlook. 

Given that states are going back into lockdown, the pandemic is worse here than in our economic challengers and the money printer is still going brrrrrrrrrrr, the polling allows for a less emotional broad view of consensus opinion.
