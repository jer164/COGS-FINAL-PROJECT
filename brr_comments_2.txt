Haha SEO go brr
Money printer do in fact go brr
Communism go brr
I still don‚Äôt understand where this money comes from, taxes? Is this being paid for later? Someone said Deficit spending but I‚Äôm not an economist. Do we just say ‚Äúmoney printer go brr‚Äù
Bullshit. Were you worried about inflation when trumps printed trillions just to pump the stock market up? Where do you think the "money printer go brr" memes came from?
Stimmy machine go brr r/nakd mooonüöÄüöÄü§ë
More of an Obama guy, drones go brr.
Money printer go BRR
Government make money machine go brr

Bank say to government point money machine at me
Fascism go brr
Haha presidential privileges go brr
If your metal detector goes brr you need to get it fixed
He got Trump to do his dirty work and fuck shit up here, and now he doesn't even have to take care of eventually removing him himself. Putin seems like the real winner to me.

Also shout out to the brr brain. Adhd feels like spaghetti on a wall. And the floor, and the ceiling too
And people forget scale here. .01% of 74,000,000 Trump voters is 74,000 people. So if the extremists lie in that percentage there is enough to gather 15k. Not that that would work. The second it gets violent Browning .50cal goes BRR BRR BRR. 

This is where the 2A arguments are idiotic. I will stop tyranny with my semi auto AR against an Abrams MBT. Shit they have the Aegis defense system on trailers to be deployed at bases. They could probably do a drive by with of those. 
The scale of firepower is 

American citizens: firecracker

American military: nukes
ha ha democratic process go brr
Shhh, money printer goes brr.
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci Gang, Gucci Gang, Gucci Gang  

Shoulda bought a mask not a new chain  
Got kicked off of the airplane  
Can't fly now, gotta take the train  

Rather go and buy Balmains (Brr)
First WestJet now this?!

‚ÄúThey kicked me out the plane off a Percocet (Brr)
Now Lil Pump flyin' private jet (Yuh)
Everybody scream, "Fuck WestJet" (Fuck 'em)‚Äù
And Trump goes ''BRR PARDON MY CRIMINAL BUDDIES!''
It's not even a matter of lying, those two statements almost contradict themselves. You could theoretically spin it to mean the poor are not worthy to be called American, but making every American richer implies making the poor richer, and that has to come from somewhere. You can't make EVERYONE rich at the same time, because inflation go brr
As a policy strategy of course but honestly going full in on fiscal and the economy will probably work better for campaign purposes. All in on lmao GOP bad with money we good with money. Economy go brr vote for D. That plus rallying minority turnout would be the ultimate two pronged attack in areas so polarized that policy talk really doesn't change any votes.
Fantastic. So blanket statements you see here are rarely ever practical. Can we stop acting like they are and that every suggestion is a total net positive? Because there is more nuance to it than just "money go brr"
Missile goes brr brr boom
Brr-rump-a-tump-TING!
I think the press secretary would probably be more liked if she ended the conferences going "brr brr brr!"
How do you expect armed dumb motherfuckers threatening to "resist" a duly elected President...?  Walk down the street arms locked together singing kumbaya?

No.

Indeed 30mm goes brr.
Rightwing Terrorist: I‚Äôll defend my rights.
A10: Haha, 30mm go brr
Haha overfunded military goes brr
They go brr non-stop till January.
It's so unnerving, they stay cleverly at the limit of outrageous illegality, and shit horrendous craps. Brr this thing alone must be the cause of quite a lot of issues in the US.
&gt;	I sell crack on PayPal (PayPal), just like Obama (Obama)
Fiji diamonds on my wrist, I fuck yo‚Äô mama (Brr)
Obama told me ‚ÄúLil Pump, boy, you moving bricks‚Äù (Oh my god)
I walk around my teacher office and I‚Äôm hitting licks (I‚Äôm hitting licks)

Best political rapper of all time
&gt; so for some of them it maybe hard to walk a mile, much less 4 miles

Also, it was dark and fairly windy. I'm in relatively good health but in that weather (with proper coat and hat and gloves) I'm still telling my dog to hurry up and pee so we can go back inside, and I'm sure as hell not taking long walks for the fun of it after dark. Brr. (I live in Lincoln, so I know what the weather was like that night... I like Biden, but I wouldn't freeze to death to hear him speak, either. To vote for him, maybe, but not to hear him talk...)
Look how long the GOP held majority after 94AWB. It's suicide to push that bullshit. Violent crime has been declining for decades regardless of AWBs being in place or not. "Assault weapons" are just a scary symbol to Bloomberg followers, not the actual issue in this country. I'm a Democrat, I own handguns, I am currently shopping for an AR-15 and standard capacity magazines for making steel plates go brr and putting holes in paper, same as 99.999% of owners. In previous elections I have swallowed my values on literally everything else and voted red down the card to block gun control measures that infringe on my personal freedom because 2A *is that important*.
Nuclear football go brr
They make everyone with a fucking soul go brr if brr is the sound of shivering at the sight of soulless monsters who devour the future and spit out pieces of shit like this brainless handmaiden.
But republicans make economy go brrüò¢

Dexamethasone go brr
Please excuse the lack of seriousness, but Trump go brr.
&gt;The President of the United States shut down borders to China and Europe to the chagrin of his critics, 

No, no he did not. After the virus was already here and spreading he instituted a ban on travel from mainland China by ethnically Chinese people only. He did not stop any other nationality that may have been in mainland from coming over and did not stop connecting flights from Europe. 40,000 people came over after this "ban". He also only stop travel from 26 European nations not Europe as a whole. And in either case, by that time he was catching up not leading. 

&gt; Congress enacted the largest stimulus package ever, and then the President extended benefits when Congress couldn't agree on policy. 

And what exactly does this do to address COVID-19 spread and containment? What policies and practices were mandated for the states to follow? 

&gt; The Federal Reserve, that private entity which at this point should be consider a part of the Federal government, makes the printing press go brr and just announced that interest rates will be zero for the foreseeable future, stating years. 

And again, what exactly does this do to address the virus specifically?

&gt; Next, the Feds have relaxed policy so that we can have a viable vaccine as quickly as bureaucratically possible, the production of which, according to the CDC, should start rolling out late this fall and in full force by summer next year.  

The FDA doesn't report to Trump and this was done independently with no central leadership directive. 

The Federal Government has not taken a leadership role in this pandemic.
Hasn't been taking charge?

Next, the Feds have relaxed policy so that we can have a viable vaccine as quickly as bureaucratically possible, the production of which, according to the CDC, should start rolling out late this fall and in full force by summer next year. This is a federal government that hasn't been taking charge?
Fuck trump, but seriously can we have some actual content on this sub? "Trump is a coward brr brr brr" is a pretty lazy argument
haha reality go brr
Love the downvotes asking about essential workers got me. Hive mind go brr
Brr has made several attempts to hinder or outright halt the investigation into the inauguration committee's suspect actions. Barr is trying to help Trump hide where the 80 million that is missing went. We know some went to some shady people, probably to be laundered directly back to Trump. There are smaller amounts that just went directly to trump, millions, and that ain't legal on any planet. The US Senate doesn't mess around when it comes to illegal actions involving money, especially if there is a ton of evidence. Kinda hard to hide 80 million, lol. Trump is fucked, unless that money can be accounted for. Knowing that idiot, and knowing how early in his political career the decisions he made regarding that money were made, he is totally fucked. Don't forget he was paying for hookers from the Oval Office in those early days, *writing checks*, oblivious to the fact that money was always gonna be traceable. He is such a moron, and he didn't get the immoral lawyers in the WH for at least 14-18 mos.  If he was doing real dumb shit 4 mos into his Presidency with Cohen and hookers, imagine what he was doing in the weeks leading up to his inauguration. What an idiot.
Haha both sides go brr
tax cuts, money printer go brr.

r/investing r/wallstreetbets for the luls
