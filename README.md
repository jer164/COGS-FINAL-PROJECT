This is an archive of the data from my final research project for a course on cognitive linguistics. 

Within this repo, you will find the Python script for pulling comment data from Reddit as well as the data used to complete the project. 
Some notes for any viewers:
1. 'comments.csv' is the master data file that contains the aggregate of all N-grams pulled from Reddit.
2. Any other 'comments.n' are just specific phrase lengths; most are concentrated around the 2-5 range. 
3. The R data files are leftover from cleaning the data but are *not* meant for replication. There is a possibility they will crash your machine if 
it does not have enough onboard memory. 


If you have any questions about re-use or other potential applications of this method, please contact me using the information in my bio.
