Joe signs it and stimulus goes brrrrrrrrr
If Covid has made anything clear, it is that our entire economy as well as democracy is one sided.  Rich and powerful are the only ones who matter.  Bailing out big business?  Money printer go brrrrrrrrr.  People literally starving and facing homelessness?  WE CAN'T GIVE THEM MONEY THEY'LL GET LAZY WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO WORK EVEN IF PEOPLE DIE.  HOW MUCH WILL THAT COST?  Funny how giving handouts to big businesses who actually did have the resources to weather a storm if they had only bothered to save a nest egg like they tell individuals to do is no problem and cost is not an object, nor is worry about the big businesses getting lazy.
