Leftist media outlets: "Nooo, you can't support Biden, he's not a *real progressive!"*  
  
Joe Biden: "Lol, progress machine go brrrr...:"
Only a fraction of what’s approved goes to the people, of course they want to print more. Money printer go brrrr.

Crypto Market go brrrr
It’s because too many people saw the brrrr meme and think money can just be printed. There was a good DD post debunking that and the irony is that it was on WSB
&gt;The point is that if we replaced the dollar with a dollar based in Bitcoin we would no longer have a federal reserve that has the power to create money out of thin air and give it to whoever they feel like.

No, instead we will have mining conglomerates that have the power to change the Bitcoin monetary system. There already have been forks due to differences of opinion around mining.

&gt;And if our money is based in Bitcoin that gives it a perpetually increasing value since it cannot be diluted like the USD is when the FED makes the printer go brrrr. Instead of everyone having money that keeps losing value we can have money that not only retains its value but increases in value. 

Until a majority of miners decide that having Bitcoin eventually stop minting coins isn't feasible long term and decide to change the algorithm for mining so a set amount is produced in perpetuity. Again, the forking and other possible "currencies" just show that the algorithms aren't set in stone. Most of those alternative currencies aren't worth the effort to integrate given Bitcoin's headstart and confidence level.

Most businesses or people don't have the luxury of trading Bitcoin for \[insert next favorite coin here\] if the miners do something they don't agree with. Trading becomes harder if you have to first find a common currency with your trading partner and most people can't afford to use an exchange for every transaction.

&gt;Also....with a money that is based in Bitcoin we can then have it sitting on a decentralized distributed ledger (blockchain) which would allow for total transparency of where the government and corporations allocate money and this would create accountability by those in charge of the distribution of dollars.

Is Bitcoin anonymous or isn't it? If you think just because the transactions are listed on the ledger they are transparent, this isn't the case. It takes effort to track down things like this and there are ways to further obfuscate matters if someone wants to have anonymity by using Bitcoin mixing or similar. Not impossible, but it isn't going to be your average citizen doing it but governments going after the little guys.

&gt;So as they continue spending obscene amounts of money for that war they  also dilute the money supply which gives the dollar less purchasing power. This means people turn to credit, loans and eventually fall into deeper debt as their purchasing power continues to decrease. Meanwhile thoughts who have access to cheap debt can make disproportionately greater returns from their investments. The middle class erodes and populism rises.

Who is the government spending obscene amounts of money to? Government isn't the only "bad guy" in this scenario you presented. There is also the military industrial complex which has plenty of CEOs, boards, and shareholders who's greed has pushed for that spending by lobbying the governments in question. Those companies have hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of citizens working.

Changing to Bitcoin wouldn't alter the landscape as much as you think. What it would do, if government sanctioned, would create winners and losers when everyone tried to trade in their current currency for Bitcoin. The winners would be those with prior knowledge it was going to occur and the losers would be the majority of society you claim to want to help. Instead of it being used to pressure the government, it would put additional financial pressure on most people because the people who bought in first got more value for their currency than the people who had to wait to buy in last.
Nobody is mining and distributing Bitcoin at their own discretion. The miners are all competing for the reward which is already predetermined. But that’s not even the point. 

The point is that if we replaced the dollar with a dollar based in Bitcoin we would no longer have a federal reserve that has the power to create money out of thin air and give it to whoever they feel like. Instead the miners are competing in a free market to create the already predetermined Bitcoin reward. And if our money is based in Bitcoin that gives it a perpetually increasing value since it cannot be diluted like the USD is when the FED makes the printer go brrrr. Instead of everyone having money that keeps losing value we can have money that not only retains its value but increases in value. 

Also....with a money that is based in Bitcoin we can then have it sitting on a decentralized distributed ledger (blockchain) which would allow for total transparency of where the government and corporations allocate money and this would create accountability by those in charge of the distribution of dollars. 

The best example I can give is this....

The war in Afghanistan has been going on for like 2 decades now, it’s been unpopular for almost as long, yet we still keep spending TRILLIONS of dollars fighting that endless war. The reason we can do that is because if the government needs more money they can just turn on the printers and keep it going instead of turning to its citizens and taxing them (which is how war happened for most of history). So as they continue spending obscene amounts of money for that war they also dilute the money supply which gives the dollar less purchasing power. This means people turn to credit, loans and eventually fall into deeper debt as their purchasing power continues to decrease. Meanwhile thoughts who have access to cheap debt can make disproportionately greater returns from their investments. The middle class erodes and populism rises. 

With Bitcoin....

The government wants to continue fighting in Afghanistan, they need more money, they can’t print more so they tax their citizens. Everyone starts asking...”why are we paying for this bullshit?”, and the government either folds to the will of the people or there is a revolution. What hasn’t happened....they didn’t turn the printers on, our dollar hasn’t diluted in value, our purchasing power has actually increased and the middle class is stronger then ever. With this financial security people are less stressed, they have more time to spend with family, and the urge to find scapegoats for their problems becomes nonexistent. We now can start focusing on making the world a better place instead and enter the 21st century with a positive outlook.
&gt; The Fed cannot straight-up buy stocks.

Haha, money printer go brrrr
Consent machine go brrrr
You would be amazed by the number of people that dont realize "tax cut" an expense in this context.  Somehow the government is supposed to exist without income while at the same time getting flooded with "money printer go brrrr" memes
Money printer go brrrr.
Money printer go brrrr
This is such a cop out imho. Like, you realize this whole thing is just made up at this point? Somebody somewhere is literally saying money machine go brrrr and a bunch of people are here saying well wait it’s making the brrr noise you can’t just do that. Either the dude is worth billions of dollars or he ain’t.
Robot dog go brrrr
It's not so much about the oil itself as it is about Saudi Arabia making OPEC trade in USD exclusively. Which makes the USD the world's reserve currency aka brrrr printer money. This is why Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya and Yemen were invaded after Saudi Arabia did 9/11.
Mississippi go brrrr
Expanded testing (Trump tried to stop testing)

Biden activated Defense Production Act (DPA) to accelerate manufacturing (Trump refused to activate because free market brrrr)

Trump Missed his administrations vaccine target. Biden is exceeding his Vaccine target.

I certainly hope he gets what he deserves but I just don't think we will get that satisfaction.
My attorney explained it that under immigration law they can roll multiple drug charges into a felony charge. He says it was most complex case he ever took on and longest ongoing, 20+years. He asked his assistant to print out the file, but quickly changed his mind when she informed him it was over 800 pages. Printer going brrrr?

Brrrr ❄️ Snowflake  has nowhere to go because Parler go bye bye :( ❄️ you can persevere!
In case you missed it America is full of angry, white people currently looking for scapegoats and China fits the bill like no other. We already dismantled Africa and sucked her dry, let's do China next! 

China, the big, formerly poor country that we found so useful, because of their cheap labor, has now lifted itself out of the morass of poverty and has begun making the first tentative steps outside of the shadow and influence of the former "world's only superpower." We should be happy for them, as they make up the majority of the human race...but, we are not. 

Now that their labor is no longer cheap and their economy is the hottest in the world, we have decided that we no longer can accept China as a friendly nation, because of their human rights record. The hypocrisy is funny at this point because our reputation is in the toilet, our allies no longer have any faith in us and our human rights record is so abysmal that we would not dare allow a court outside of our control to take an oversight role in any matter pertaining to the USA, no matter how legit.

Seeing as American greed is what really helped give China the leg up she needed in the first place, it is not a good look for us to turn on them like this. Biden might say "tough on China," but in reality he will not be following through because we sold our economic soul to China long ago. If Trump refused to go the tough route on China then you know Biden won't either. It is all symbolic anyway. There is no way to go hard against China without doing more harm to our own economy than we do to theirs. We share a symbiotic relationship in which both will suffer if one goes down. 

I already know that my fellow countrymen are not the type of people who take the path of least resistance. Oh no, we are going to attempt the impossible and try to put yet another genie back in the fucking bottle. That is simply who we are. With our never say quit ethos in mind, we owe China trillions of USD plus interest (which we cannot pay) and we have an explosive trade deficit contributing to the sum each day. I wonder if we will quit paying. Trump poured the world's finest accelerant on all these fires with his ill advised, gamelike foreign policy toward China. Don't worry tho, we still have true believers all over America who are dying to bring back the trump domestic policies and foreign policy regime. 

Trade got so bad under DJT that our exports in Nov and Dec 2020 were left to rot on the ports so the shippers could use the empty containers to bring more of the more lucrative imports from China to the USA. You see where this is heading right?

The tearing at the seams that we are seeing around the edges of the US economy spell doom, but because of our huge arsenal of weapons, the obsolete, (but still in use) petrodollar, and the fact that our money printer always goes brrrr, we still have the appearance of a legitimate entity. 

Who knows what shape America's economy is actually in. I'm not even sure if it matters what shape it's in as long as nobody finds out.... Trump has fucked all the numbers. He even tried to fuck the census numbers. The numbers we make all our decisions and calculations by. Trump is more incompetent than reagan was and even dumber than bush jr was and yet he has acolytes and sycophants who are ready to die for him. Whatever happened to America it was a fatal blow. We might continue on as a zombie, but it's pretty clear that we will never again achieve the heights we once did and our status as the world's only superpower is virtually meaningless due to the changes in the global order. 

I wonder if the republicans realise that Trump has done so much structural damage to the American machine that we may never recover? Do they know that shrinking the government is no guarantee of a better outcome and that we might leave ourselves open to being taken over by another nation. Shit, the way things are going America might get taken over by Tesla. Saddest part is the portion of us who would cheer Elon as our new overlord is not small.

We go wild at the stock market gains, but seem to forget that main street sustains wallstreet, not the other way around. Our shallow and hollow howling about Hong Kong, Taiwan and human rights abuses is also laughable in the face of our own actions. Funny how we only ever even bring up China's human rights record when we need something from them. Was China innocent all the decades before when we needed their cooperation so we could mint new billionaire CEO's? We offshored our entire manufacturing sector to China. Did we forget?

We are a nation that has double standards so clearly defined that they might as well be enshrined in the constitution. Oh wait, they are! Or at the very least they were, when it was written. If only America would look inward and if only we could agree if it were night or day, maybe we could agree on dissolving the union and starting over from scratch.
Government spending has become untethered from externalities like inflation. This has been the case for decades. Printer literally does go "brrrr". USD is still extremely strong, they can't make enough of the shit vs  how much demand there is globally for it. Ask any reputable economist and they'll tell you that our potential GDP is underutilized right now, and only the central bank is in a position to juice that productivity with any sort of speed relative to the severity of the crisis. Without stimulus, the pain from this lasts 10x longer. The "but how are you gonna pay for it" argument has been moot since the early 2000s. We still need taxes so that there is some sort of leverage over fiscal policy, but normal people get money *back* from their taxes.
Money printer go brrrr
I major in economics. I’m not saying Trump was a good president by any means, or that his policies had 0 effect on the economy, but the truth is the effect presidents have on the economy is grossly overestimated, and Biden alone won’t be the single reason why the economy recovers. A large part of the recovery we saw earlier had to do with the Federal Reserve (Jerome Powell) stepping in and lowering interest rates to near zero (hence all the money printer go brrrr memes) I don’t doubt that quicker vaccinations and a president who promotes science instead of hindering it will play a role in the economic recovery. But don’t count on Biden as your one and only savior from economic distress. There’s still several things that need to be done which are out of his purview and have much greater implications:

-Congress needs to approve stimulus checks to people and pass a $15min wage law

-States need to adjust budgets and lockdown measures 

-The medical community and logistical companies need to have a well organized plan on vaccine distribution 

And much more.
Tyranny go brrrr.
By academic definition you are correct. However the pain isn’t being distributed equally. I was watching PBS and one of the political correspondents was explaining that for the bottom quartile of the socioeconomic strata unemployment is closer to 20% (not even talking about underemployment or workforce participation) while the top two quartiles are seeing 5%. 

A lot of small business are loading up on personal and business debt to try to push through. As more of them are pushed over the cliff, that’s 40% of your labor market at risk. 

So let’s call it whatever we want but there are big portions of our society that are getting hit hard. 

There is also a lot of research that coming out of depressions companies hire less and less back than previously. 

Fed policies (brrrr), eviction moratoriums, unemployment checks are all propping things up. We will see if they can outlast this situation. Time to get back to normalcy is the key variable.
Progressives: "No, you can't just think Joe Biden is a good president, he's not a *real* progressive!" 

Joe Biden: "Lol, progress machine go brrrr...:"
It's so hard to look at that kind of future, because it's not necessarily going to see these dollars go away, since they'll be spent in our economy.  Also, the stock market didn't crash because of Jpow's money machine go brrrr, and we're in debt to a tune of $4tn due to that and the other stimulus bills that gave huge gains to companies.  

&gt;As of August 31, 2020, federal debt held by the public was $20.83 trillion and intragovernmental holdings were $5.88 trillion, for a total national debt of $26.70 trillion.

So the public has some leveraged debt as well, and so long as governmental stays under 2/3 of that, we shouldn't tank too much, but we wouldn't notice likely for a couple years anyways.   

Bear in mind that our economy isn't the only one hurt, so this isn't happening just to us, and this is a global pandemic, which cut out 40m jobs, and saw almost 1m new ranks applying for unemployment.  Regardless of how much it may hurt in the future, we can't afford to be as stupid as Republicans were the last 10 month and do absolutely fuck all while people get evicted and can't make payments on anything.  

It's also worth noting that many red states don't give extended unemployment, so people who were laid off at pandemic's beginning may have been dropped recently off unemployment at 6 months and that's going to cause another mass panic.
And considered radical. I mean, [she is presented as a symmetry of Greene](https://www.axios.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-aoc-troublemakers-60f9dece-4eec-4bc2-967a-e69df8749f0e.html). You know one is a radical because she believes forest fires are started by jewish space-lasers and the other one is a radical because she does not want to work with a person who conspired to murder her...

I really wish US democrats had even a moderately radical left wing. There is a symmetrical conspiracy theorism on the left, where everything bad is caused by the greed of big financial institutions, where companies can't do anything correctly, where all problems could be solved by destroying capitalism. It is simply not represented among elected dems officials.

All you have is radical centrism that says that... companies should be accountable? Brrrr, what a scary socialist agenda!
Haha GameStop stock go brrrr.

They are issuing bonds already, I mean that money printer simply doesn't go brrrr, money printer goes brrrr by issuing treasury bonds, and there is a limit to that, and it is not inflation. Inflation is not a real consideration here.
&gt; It seems like neither party really cares and I guess as long as USD is the reserve currency and we have a powerful military it doesn’t really matter.

Because that IS how it works. US debt holders receive tens of billions in interest per year on that debt, and the currency remains remarkable stable 99% of the time due to reserve status. They have no reason to try and "recall" the debt, for them it's like a rental property. They pay in big once to buy the debt and get endless monthly payments forever in trade. There's a reason the "budget ceiling" gets raised every single year, because so long as there isn't a global financial issue which affects the use and trade of USD globally (Hello 2008) then frankly debt literally doesn't matter, and the US money printer can just go brrrr with impunity.

National debt isn't personal debt. They function very, very differently.
Free market go brrrr

This wont matter in a month.
Dude I'm in tears from "the money printer go brrrr" so thank you for brightening my day.
I’m used to AZ and neighboring NM.  Even young people say they’ll exchange 1 month of wearing puffy parkas in Albuquerque^note vs more months of shorts weather in Phoenix (with more nightlife and shopping).  That then changes the politics, especially as Californians love to retire in mostly Phoenix.  

(note) Little do they know Arizonans wear puffy jackets too ... when it goes below a frigid 70°F (brrrr, bring out the Arctic Gear).

moneyprinter goes brrrr wageslave still work for monopoly money lmao
How do y’all plan to pay for all of this?

If you give the ~200 million adults in America $1000 a month, that alone will cost the government $2.4 trillion annually. Toss in about $3 trillion a year for Medicare for all and you’re up to $5.4 trillion annually.  This is more than the $4.4 trillion we spent on the entire government in 2019.  And that was at a deficit of about $1 trillion annually.  Oh, and now we’re talking about subsidizing housing too.  Why not?  If you’re going to just print money, may as well go big or go home, I guess.

Our massive spending and refusal to pay for it with taxes is going to absolutely drown us.  I’m not at all opposed to big actions to address big problems—and automation, health care costs, and climate change will all require massive governmental efforts to address.   But until we fix our “money printer go brrrr” problem, I don’t think we should even indulge such fantasies.

Oh, and you can’t solve everything by taxing the rich.  Stock options can’t be used to pay taxes.  We will all need to pay higher taxes to get out of the mess we are in and start adding these new programs.

It is the guaranteed government loans that drove the prices so high in the first place. It’s like whack a mole. Every time the government guarantees/hands money out in one place, it increases costs or reduces value somewhere else, and these scenarios are usually exacerbated by greed.

When you say “forgive the debt” do you mean “make it vanish” so the schools just never get it, or do you mean “just have the government print the money and give it right to the schools?”

Because the second is the reality of it, and do you think that will incentivize the schools to reduce their costs, or just keep increasing their costs even faster, because money printer goes brrrr?

The cost of acquiring the asset has already been paid - the marginal cost/benefit needs to be focused on who can create more benefits for society with x amount of money. Households having x amount of debt forgiven or the government not printing x amount of dollars because they don’t have to write off these loans.

Not to mention actual spending is likely significantly above that. Not to mention the Pentagon "lost" 21 TRILLION dollars. We could house, clothe, and feed every citizen but instead we just get raw dogged year after year. I have dual citizenship with Canada, genuinely thinking about moving there. I've lived hear my whole life but it's just so disheartening day after day.

Edit: And I'm not even bad off in comparison to most!

Brrrr what a shrieking harpy, why do you behave like this.
The meltdown is the dollar losing its value due to inflation aka the printer go brrrr meme. Crypto currency will have value because it will work with the new CBDCs, there’s no infinite supply like fiat currency and it’s very liquid allowing transactions to occur much faster which will be needed with all those extra trillion $s on the Feds balance sheet. Also I highly doubt the internet is going anywhere they wanna track your ass on 5g and put in the new quantum financial system.
The last stimulus included about $4 trillion to prop up the stock market.

Money printer goes brrrr. When it inevitably breaks down, everything crashes. Until it breaks down, the market is no longer free, so the rules change from free market to "who knows?" Also, dollars lose value, which is inflation.  You probably noticed that prices are going up more than you are used to. It's more of a burden when they double every month or week or day. Which is not unlikely.
Money printer go brrrr. Fuck the cost that our kids will pay for. I'm fine with some relief but I know too many people making more on unemployment now than they did working pre covid.
&gt; Shame the value of the dollar has degraded... my portfolio is dented even though US stocks are 'up'.

Unless you're in like a 1% equity allocation there is no way your overall portfolio is down since the start of COVID. The US dollar is down around 3% this year while the S&amp;P500 is up almost 52% since the March lows. 

&gt; Print more please J Pow, I can buy more at a discount.

This doesn't even make sense. If the Fed prints more that will cause equity values to go up and the US dollar to lose value. You can't buy more on discount when printers go brrrr, what happens is the exact opposite.
inherited a few wars he didnt stop, started a few new wars, eh whats it matter stock market go brrrr

Trump in headline, ratings go brrrr.  


Howard Stern effect.   


Most publishing desks didn't give a shit if they were enabling Trump. It was probably the first time their view count and ad numbers actually performed well in years.   


Trump was rocket fuel controversy for press organizations that didn't have much to attach to during the "no drama" Obama era.  


Junkies can't help themselves.
They don't want to.  Last time Dems did this it ended uo benefiting Trump and McConnel most.

&gt;On November 21, 2013, Senate Democrats used the so-called "nuclear option," voting 52–48 — with all Republicans and three Democrats opposed — to eliminate the use of the filibuster on executive branch nominees and judicial nominees, except to the Supreme Court.

This is how they packed our courts...this is a dumb short sighted plan that would provide the most immediate relief from Trumps appointments but once again its a mess Dems made themselves and this is yet another messy solution.  I keep getting downvoted for this because Brrrr Obama Go Politics...but his record as President is precisely why he doesn't deserve the benefit of the doubt.

Killing the fillibuster is only effective so long as Dems never lose a branch of government again and only possible if we win Congress back...Dems are so lost rn...
Buy the motherfuckin' dip!  Don't you know the JPow money printer go \*brrrr\*?
I'm tired..  I read "Trump go brrrr" and chuckled...
No shit Sherlock. You have millions unemployed, with little to no job prospects, and the unemployment boost is going away. We can't spend what we don't have. 22% of the country is about to be living off ramen if they weren't already, and possibly living in their cars. But will they help the people? Probably not. It's makes them more money to make the money printer go brrrr and prop up Wall Street. That's the economy they care about, not Main Street.
That is what you got from her ignorant tirade? All I heard from it was "HEHAW HEHAW BRRRR". 

She is a phony.

Money printer go "brrrr."
J Pow making his money printing machines go Brrrr...

Yes the Fed is taking actions to stabilize the market which is inflating stock prices and disconnecting the stock market from the economy. Though part of this is expected during a market downturn with QE and all time low bond rates and a risky municipal bond market is pushing more investors into the stock market.
Money printer goes brrrr

Don’t get me wrong, I hate it but that’s how it goes

This has nothing to do with Trump supporters other then them laughing about this book...

Clowning strategically serves to sway or foster a negative view of media Trump calls fake-news. It serves to increase a weariness of watching Democrats and left-leaning media chase 'orange man bad' or worse encourage countermove by Dems to attempt an investigations or removal.

Do not count the economy out, in fact that is an example of administrative maneuvers. While covid was raging and Trump appeared to be losing- the maga took control of the Fed more/less. This includes the ability to make the dollar machines go brrrr.  If Trump wanted to out FDR or out Keynes or other out lefting of the left- dude can, he is the defacto chairman of the Fed, Jerome is window dressing.
.. Ivanka's granted patent for Chinese-made voting machines goes brrr...

Imagine thinking the bailouts come from tax funds. Money printer go brrrr....
I feel this [bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-27/federal-reserve-s-financial-cure-risks-being-worse-than-disease) article explains it in better detail but here are the highlights from the article.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

TLDR-  The federal government is nationalizing large swaths of the financial markets. The Fed is providing the money to do it. BlackRock will be doing the trades.  This scheme essentially merges the Fed and Treasury into one organization. So, meet your new Fed chairman, Donald J. Trump who can make the money printers go brrrr by buying securities and hand out loans to ramp financial markets higher going into the election.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Some Details.....

The Fed created 5 new programs

 

* CPFF (Commercial Paper Funding Facility) – buying commercial paper from the issuer.
* PMCCF (Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility) – buying corporate bonds from the issuer.
* TALF (Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility) – funding backstop for asset-backed securities.
* SMCCF (Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility) – buying corporate bonds and bond ETFs in the secondary market.
* MSBLP (Main Street Business Lending Program) – Details are to come, but it will lend to eligible small and medium-size businesses, complementing efforts by the Small Business Association.

&amp;#x200B;

 Fed isn’t allowed to do this. The central bank is only allowed to purchase or lend against securities that have government guarantee. This includes Treasury securities, agency mortgage-backed securities and the debt issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. An argument can be made that can also include municipal securities, but nothing in the laundry list above. 

Here is the 'How'

 The Fed will finance a special purpose vehicle (SPV) for each acronym listed above to conduct these operations. The Treasury, using the Exchange Stabilization Fund, will make an equity investment in each SPV and be in a “first loss” position.  

What does this mean?

So the Treasury, not the Fed, is buying all these securities and backstopping of loans; the Fed is acting as banker and providing financing. The Fed hired BlackRock Inc. to purchase these securities and handle the administration of the SPVs on behalf of the owner (US Treasury)

 

For the Fed to get the authority to stabilize these “private” markets, central bankers needed the Treasury to agree to nationalize (own) them so they could provide the funds to do it.

In effect, the Fed is giving the Treasury access to its printing press. This means that, in the extreme, the administration would be free to use its control, not the Fed’s control, of these SPVs to instruct the Fed to print more money so it could buy securities and hand out loans in an effort to ramp financial markets higher going into the election.

This is why Trump/supporters really aren't sweating covid or a long hot summer (domestic &amp; global) . If they need the money to 'buy' the election they have it their finger tips.

Oh btw, in case you never bothered to learn about the maga's agenda, like actual details vs rhetoric found on the news/articles with left-leaning views....

The want to install a new government which includes a new multilateral monetary framework (securing the Fed was a huge win to restructure it for their goals).
I always feel like Republicans are better at long term strategy. Mitch I think was quoted as saying how short people's memories are.  The contrast between the obstructionist republican response in 2008 to the 'let the stimulus printer go brrrr and who cares about the debt' being a recent example.

Mitch said obstructing Obama's supreme court pick and the recent stacking of the courts are good examples of this. 

Do you agree with this?  

How can Democrats learn and adapt some republican strategies here around playing the long game?

Corporations are now nations brrrr
There is plenty of food, the grocery stores are throwing it away because people aren't taking it. The trouble is the stores insist on taking slips of paper (or equivalent) for the food, which not all people have... 

Maybe the government could tell the stores to let the people take the food, and set up a system where they dole out
 *different* slips of paper to represent how much food you can take. We could call it "food stamps", and in a time like this where many don't have the normal transferable paper the government could expand this system to more people, so that less of the food is wasted and less families need feeding.

Or you know, economy machine go 'brrrr', let's throw Mom and Dad into the gears so that Tommy can eat.

I was opposed to universal healthcare because the US insurance industry employees a lot of people and laying them all off will take a huge toll on the economy. But while the economy is fucked and the money printer go brrrr, this is the right time to enact universal healthcare, and maybe even UBI.
Don't fall for ponzi scheme ICOs. BTC printer can't go brrrr.
What does militia have to do with this? Are you referring to the prefatory clause of the Second Amendment? Because the prefatory clause ("A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state...") doesn't modify the operative clause (...the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed).

It could read "Because space aliens might attack someday and it would suck to get killed by aliens, the right of the people..." or "Since guns are lit af, the right of the people..." or "Lol gun go brrrr, the right of the people..." and the right being guaranteed would be the same; the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.

Unfortunately, the author doesn't consider all the synthetic forces being applied to the market in the form of qualitative easing and any other artificial manipulations that will result from the next screaming call from Trump to Powell. It's possible that these things will later cause huge impacts of unknown nature due to the novelty of the situation: we've never had an a world economy based on a currency run by a government quite as reckless as this one.

Will the mortgage industry collapse from all the defaults when forebearance ends and all those old payments become due? Will the world see through our insane addition of currency and devalue the dollar to the point of hyperinflation? Will we see a credit crunch as consumer spending drops to never before seen lows?

Nobody knows. Anyone who claims to know is selling something.

TL;DR: money printer go brrrr
This is actually, in my opinion, the biggest error (from a fiscal policy) standpoint our government made when dealing with this:

The stimulus package should have been written to address 1. lost wages and healthcare availability for out of work employees, and 2. lost revenue from impacted businesses. No loans, just cash injection (BRRRR), and each month a new package should have been updated to address that month's needs. Instead we have half of our government pushing back against business stimulus at the cost of citizens, while the other half dangles a single $1,200 check that most people won't see until the summer.   

Add to that a mortgage freeze offset by monetary solutions (directed to the banks) and a rent freeze (offset by the aforementioned fiscal policy which would cover landlords), and literally everyone is covered.   

Watching other governments pass sensible, immediate stimulus while our own bickered over airplane emissions was frustrating and embarrassing.
